# BiobaseNewick

This is a simple parser for Newick trees. The parser returns a rose tree. Each
node is labelled with the node name (or an empty string for anonymous nodes)
and a distance (0 if not given).

Newick trees can be ex- and imported into the Newick tree format. We also have
serialization to the usual serializers.

This package was written mostly to complement a course a Univ. Leipzig. There
is a more comprehensive package written by R. Newton
<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/phybin> which you might want instead.
